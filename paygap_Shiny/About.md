About BumpAhead -- "My call was never to be a superhero."

Part of figuring out how to be a working mother involves making the right decisions as to how to care for her child while she is at work. Her options vary depending on location, industry, income level and family structure. This HackThePayGap application for workers titled "BumpAhead" is an attempt at better understanding the dynamics involved and help determine and initiate further steps required to address it.

In the United States, 80.6% of single parents are mothers. Among this percentage of single mothers: 45% of single mothers are currently divorced or separated, 1.7% are widowed, 34% of single mothers never have been married. (Source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_parent)

The average cost of childcare in the US is $11,666 per year ($972 per month). (Source: Babycenter.com)

The federal poverty level for a family of 3 is $20,090. For a family of 2 it is $15,930. (Source: Obamacare.net) This means low income families are spending more than half of their income on child care. (Source: American Progress)

When women leave the workforce, even for a short period of time, their potential future earnings decrease drastically. When they do not leave, the pay gap is not as large.

How are low income families, and especially low income single mothers, expected to stay in the workforce when they have children?


This is how our design will address this problem.
Through a game, we will demonstrate how the high cost of child care pushes low income women out of the workforce, decreasing their potential future earnings and making it more difficult for them to pull their families out of poverty.

Our game puts players in the shoes of low income mothers so that they can build empathy and understand the severity of this problem. 

It will end with a call to action for low income mothers - to apply for child care subsidies.

Low income mothers

Dilema 
The cost of childcare is prohibitive and makes it extremely difficult for low income mothers to stay in the workforce

Why should anyone care: because children who grow up in poverty are more likely to have developmental issues, spend time in jail, etc. They are less likely to graduate high school and attend college. 

Theory of change
Government subsidies are available to help low income families afford child care.
By making it clear how to apply for subsidies, low income mothers may be more likely to apply for them.
If women receive child care subsidies, they can stay in the workforce.
If women stay in the workforce, their earning potential is higher. 
With more money, they are more likely to pull their families out of poverty.
If they do not grow up in poverty, their children have a much more promissing future.

By raising awareness we can encourage our users to put pressure on the government to improve the handling and increase the quantity of these subsidies.


These are our objectives.
Primary objective
To help low income mothers by providing them with information on how to receive child care subsidies in their states. 

Secondary objective
Raise awareness among current and prospective parents, and encourage them to put pressure on their representatives to improve the allocation of child care subsidies. 

Tertiary objective
Create a model for exploring other issues mothers face that contribute to the gender pay gap.
