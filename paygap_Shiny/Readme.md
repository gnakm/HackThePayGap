Part of figuring out how to be a working mother involves making the right decisions as to how to care for her child while she is at work. Her options vary depending on location, industry, income level and family structure. 

[1] "In the United States, 80.6% of single parents are mothers. Among this percentage of single mothers: 45% of single mothers are currently divorced or separated, 1.7% are widowed, 34% of single mothers never have been married." (Reference: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_parent) 

[2] "Around 49% of single mothers have never married, 51% are either divorced, separated or widowed. Half have one child, 30% have two. About two thirds are White, one third Black, one quarter Hispanic."(Reference: https://singlemotherguide.com/single-mother-statistics/).
