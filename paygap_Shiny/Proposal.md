BumpAhead Project Proposal

5%

Mothers hourly wages are 5% lower than non-mothers.
Per child. 
That means the more children we have, we should expect a larger pay disparity.

We are not mothers ourselves, but upon hearing this, we were outraged. How could we be paying moms less than other women? 

To get a better understanding of this issue, we talked to working mothers and managers. The problem is larger than just a salary.
We heard a lot of stories about feeling judged by colleagues, struggling to find jobs while pregnant, taking on the massive responsibility of making sure their children have every opportunity and trying to find balance and still be a superhero working mother.

We mapped a mother's journey from pregnancy back to the workplace and realized a consistent theme was the difficult decision of how to best care for your child once you go back to work. 

The average cost of childcare in the US is $11,666 per year ($972 per month). (Source: Babycenter.com)

The federal poverty level for a family of 3 is $20,090. For a family of 2 it is $15,930. (Source: Obamacare.net) This means low income families are spending more than half of their income on child care. (Source: American Progress) and even women in the middle class could be spending 25% of their earnings on child care. 

In many cases, it makes more sense to take a few years off working or work part-time until the children start school. 

This is what takes us back to that 5% - when women leave the workforce, even for a short period of time, their potential future earnings decrease drastically. 

How are low income families, and especially low income single mothers, expected to stay in the workforce when they have children?


We are making a game to demonstrate how the high cost of child care pushes low income women out of the workforce, decreasing their potential future earnings and making it more difficult for them to pull their families out of poverty.

Bump ahead puts players in the shoes of mothers figuring out how to care for their children.

It walks them through a series of decisions, mapped to scenarios women find themselves in everyday.

So that players can build empathy and understand the severity of this problem.

We believe that the true ability to understand another is to walk through the journey and conditions of a person and face the decisions he or she would have to make in a certain situation.

The game will end with information about how low and middle income mothers can apply for subsidies through the Child Care and Development Fund, a multibillion-dollar federal and state partnership adminstered by OCC to promote family economic self sufficiency and to help children succeed. http://www.acf.hhs.gov/programs/occ/about/what-we-do 

When children attend high quality day care and early education programs, they are more likely to do well in school, find good jobs, have fewer interactions with the justice system, and have greater earnings as adults than those who donâ€™t.https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2015/01/21/fact-sheet-helping-all-working-families-young-children-afford-child-care

When they can afford high quality care, mothers can stay in the workforce, increasing their potential for future earnings. 

With more money, they are more likely to pull their families out of poverty. If their children don't grow up in poverty, they have a much more promising future.(theory of change)

Bump ahead is intended for a wide audience, with the goal of raising awareness of how the high cost of child care adds to the gender pay gap. We hope it creates a model to explore some of the other barriers that keep women from earning equal pay.
